11-2 final project (I forgot to commit this after class!)

Isabelle is going to look for some dataset for art market around the world.

Ethan is going to work on his project based on some baseball game season dataset.

I found three interesting dataset that I might going to work on for my project: one is a data about online streaming application, one is about coursera course dataset, and one is collecting all the data about Harry Potter world characters!
